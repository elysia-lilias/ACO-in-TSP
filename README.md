# ACO-in-TSP
Ant colony algorithm in solving tsp (finished years before);  
Add chaos part based on the idea in "Solving Traveling Salesman Problem by Chaos Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm" by GAO Shang;  
Cities = [  ]; are the location of cities we need to go through;  
Still working on aco in image edge detecting;   
Output: Left image: length of shortest path each trip
        Right: the optimal path
